# FPGA Minesweeper
This is our project on implementing a Minesweeper on a Basys3 FPGA.

## Project Workflow
- Create a branch named after the **feature**, for example `oled-api` or `extend-ip`;
- **Switch to the branch you created and do all the work there, not on `main`**;
- When ready, create a pull request and **add everyone else as the reviewer**;
- When everyone reviewed the code, merge the pull request.

## Task Breakdown

#### Nov 7 - 13
- Implement API for OLED peripheral
- Implement minimips with extended IP + "absolute jump" instruction
- C coding for RNG & map generation
